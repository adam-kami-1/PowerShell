Still working version of replacement for cmdlet Get-Help

## Issues in original Get-Help to be solved by my own solution:

- [X] When text is longer than the available screen width then in console version text is broken even inside word.
- [X] When text is longer than the available screen width then in window (-ShowWindow) version text is broken on word boundaries but inentation is lost. IMHO next lines should be indented like the first one, or in some cases hanging paragraph should be used.
- [ ] Aliases for cmdlets are not shown in cmdlet help.
- [ ] Aliases for parameter names should be displayed, when their definition is present in MAML file.
- [X] In section Outputs, there is missing indentation of return value description in window version. In console version works better.
- [X] Missing section header for Examples in console version. Example titles and example contents are not indented.
- [ ] HelpFiles about_* are displayed as pure text files, without any formatting. So in narrow console/windows they looks messy, and in wide looks strange.

## Things that are not an issue, but some prettyfing can be easy done (IMHO):

- [X] Lists should be displayed without empty lines separating usually paragraphs. E.g. See the list of acceptable values for parameter -Category in Get-Help.
- [X] The contents of example should be indented so example titles can be seen easier.
- [X] The example contents should be separated with emply line from the next example title.

## Issues to be solved in my implementation:
- [ ] Common parameters in Syntax section.
- [ ] Displaying of about_* HelpFiles.
- [ ] Displaying autogenerated help for external scripts.
- [ ] Displaying autogenerated help for functions.
